Differences to searx
====================

SearXNG is a fork of `searx`_.  Here are some of the changes:

.. _searx: https://github.com/searx/searx


User experience
---------------

- Huge update of the simple theme:

  * usable on desktop, tablet and mobile
  * light and dark versions (you can choose in the preferences)
  * support right-to-left languages
  * `see the screenshots <https://dev.searxng.org/screenshots.html>`_

- the translations are up to date, you can contribute on `Weblate`_
- the preferences page has been updated:

  * you can see which engines are reliable or not
  * engines are grouped inside each tab
  * each engine has a description

- thanks to the anonymous metrics, it is easier to report a bug of an engine and
  thus engines get fixed more quickly

  - if you don't want any metrics to be recorded, you can `disable them on the server
    <https://docs.searxng.org/admin/engines/settings.html#general>`_

- administrator can `block and/or replace the URLs in the search results
  <https://github.com/searxng/searxng/blob/5c1c0817c3996c5670a545d05831d234d21e6217/searx/settings.yml#L191-L199>`_


Setup
-----

- you don't need `Morty`_ to proxy the images even on a public instance
- you don't need `Filtron`_ to block bots, we implemented the builtin `limiter`_
- you get a well maintained `Docker image`_, now also built for ARM64 and ARM/v7 architectures
- alternatively we have up to date installation scripts

.. _Docker image: https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker


Contributing is easier

- readable debug log
- contributions to the themes are made easier, check out our `Development
  Quickstart`_ guide

- the dependencies are up to date
